The app can be financed by the city hall of every city from Romania and even outside the country. It's an amazing way to create a community of people that help each other and support the growth of the city together.

# Move 2gether
Move2gether is a mobile app that uses real time locations of the users in order to track the public transport vehicles from Timisoara. 
When a user is close to a station, he/she gets a notification on the phone to confirm on which public transport vehicle he/she is and all the other users get a notification that that public transport vehicle left that station.
```bash
